        "\n",
        "- The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how they are executed by a computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled Languages - The code is translated before execution into machine code by a compiler and This machine code is then executed directly by the CPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted Languages - The code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime and There is no separate compilation step; the interpreter directly runs the script.\n",

        "Qus2.  What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution. It allows your program to handle unexpected situations gracefully instead of crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Qus3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block is used to ensure that certain code runs no matter what happens, whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from a database.\n",

        "Qus10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Logging is a crucial feature in software development that helps track events, debug issues, and monitor application performance. Instead of using print(), logging provides a structured, flexible, and scalable way to capture important information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Qus11.  What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management in Python is the process of allocating, using, and freeing memory efficiently to ensure optimal program performance.\n",

        "Qus12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Use try to wrap risky code ,\n",
        "  Use except to catch exceptions ,\n",
        "  Use else to execute code only if no exception occurs ,\n",

        "Qus15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python's garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically managing memory by reclaiming unused memory and preventing memory leaks. This helps ensure that programs run efficiently and resources are used optimally.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        " The multiprocessing module provides a higher-level API for creating and managing processes. It abstracts many of the complexities involved in process creation and allows for easier communication between processes.\n",

        "\n",
        " Qus19.  What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - losing a file in Python is crucial to ensure proper resource management and to prevent potential issues with file handling. When you open a file using Python’s open() function, the system allocates resources to manage that file. If the file is not closed properly, it can lead to various problems.\n",
